# Local scripts
## Some scripts I've used from time to time on my Linux machine. 
- bash_profile : change the colour of the bash prompt based on the current git porcelain condition.  (red not staged, yellow staged, green committed)
- days_from_now.py : Python script to return the date based on number of days entered.  
- redshift.sh : fix a bug in Linux where the redshift program kept crashing. Set the exact Latitude Longitude values for Toronto for best red shift.
- reset_chrome.sh : completely remove stuck files in Chrome for clean reload.
- update_vscode.sh : wget the latest package and install it in case of Linux error or older repository.
### Urbanterror Scripts
- urt_at_35_percent.sh : script to run urbanterror FPS with reduced volume then run the urtlaunch.sh script
- urtlaunch.sh : setup log path entries for urbanterror FPS.
- urtparse.py : Python 2.7 script that filters out specific player chat based on their nickname.
